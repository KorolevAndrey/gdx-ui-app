gdx-ui-app
==========

A starting point for LibGDX applications that utilize the scene2d.ui, skins etc.


This is basically a gradle-created libgdx project with added code in the core project.

packages in core:
-com.broken_e.ui
    this is where the base classes are that you would inherit from
-com.broken_e.ui.testapp
    this is the testapp that extends the base classes and creates a simple crappy game to demonstrate
-com.broken_e.utils
    some generic data types i made that i use
