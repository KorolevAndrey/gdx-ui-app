gdx-ui-app
==========

An example very simple game entirely using scene2d.ui.  Also has reusable classes (i.e. UiApp and BaseScreen) to get a new game started with screens that transition.  It wouldn't fit every case, for example if you wanted to use an AssetLoader.  

NOTE: This code works but there might be issues or better ways to do things. Use as an example or as you wish.
